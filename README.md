AlgoWhiz is an AI-powered educational chatbot engineered to simplify the learning of computer science algorithms for students and educators alike. Developed as a senior capstone project, it seamlessly integrates natural language processing, dynamic code generation, and voice-based interaction to deliver personalized guidance on topics ranging from sorting and searching to graph theory and data structures. Built using Python, Flask, and the OpenAI API, AlgoWhiz stands as a robust, scalable tool that combines technical rigor with intuitive user experience, transforming complex concepts into accessible knowledge for all learners and educators.

## Features & Technical Details
- **Personalized Algorithm Tutoring:** AlgoWhiz leverages OpenAI’s GPT models, Python, and Flask to deliver interactive, real-time explanations for algorithms ranging from basic sorting and searching to advanced graph theory and dynamic programming.
- **Natural Language Processing at Core:** Robust NLP lets users ask complex algorithmic questions and receive detailed, context-sensitive code snippets, step breakdowns, and analogies in multiple languages.
- **Conversational Learning:** Voiceflow and Carrd interfaces provide a seamless chat experience, closely simulating a live tutoring session and promoting back-and-forth inquiry.
- **Scalable Backend Architecture:** Python and Flask power a lightweight, responsive backend, while an SQL database ensures efficient retrieval of explanations and user queries.
- **Efficient Algorithm Handling:** Backend logic executes algorithmic queries at near-optimal time and space complexity for supported problems (e.g., sorting in \(O(n \log n)\), search in \(O(n)\)), ensuring fast, insightful responses to users.
- **Collaborative Development:** Created for CS 4366 Senior Capstone; teamwork prioritized modular design, rigorous version control, and integration of industry-standard AI and web tools.
- **Educational Outcomes:** The system is engineered for clarity and retention, emulating the latest computer science curriculum standards and challenging users to deepen their understanding through adaptive questioning and example generation.
