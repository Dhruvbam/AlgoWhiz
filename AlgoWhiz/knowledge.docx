Introduction to Algorithms

Definition: Step-by-step procedure for calculations.
Purpose: Solve problems and perform tasks in computing.
Importance: Foundation of software engineering and data processing.
Algorithm Complexity

Time Complexity: How the execution time of an algorithm changes with the size of the input.
Space Complexity: The amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion.
Big O Notation: Describes the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
Data Structures

Arrays: Store data elements of the same type.
Linked Lists: Sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
Stacks: LIFO (last in, first out) data structure.
Queues: FIFO (first in, first out) data structure.
Trees: Hierarchical structure with a root value and subtrees.
Graphs: Set of nodes connected by edges.
Hash Tables: Implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values.
Sorting Algorithms

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
Merge Sort: Divides the unsorted list into n sublists, then merges them to produce a new sorted sublist.
Quick Sort: Divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays, then recursively sort the sub-arrays.
Search Algorithms

Linear Search: Sequentially checks each element of the list.
Binary Search: Efficiently find an item from a sorted list of items.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Traverses as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Traverses all the neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Graph Algorithms

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
Kruskal's Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
Prim's Algorithm: Also used to find the minimum spanning tree.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
Dynamic Programming

Concept: Breaks down problems into subproblems and solves each subproblem only once, storing the solution in a table to avoid the work of recomputing the solution every time.
Applications: Fibonacci sequence, shortest path problems, and many others.
Greedy Algorithms

Concept: Makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum.
Applications: Knapsack problem, Huffman coding.
Algorithm Design Paradigms

Divide and Conquer: Divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves each recursively, and then combines the solutions.
Backtracking: Produces all possible solutions for a problem and chooses the best solution.
Algorithmic Strategies

Brute Force: Try all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found.
Randomized Algorithms: Use a degree of randomness as part of the logic.
